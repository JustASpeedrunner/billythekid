# Billy the Kid: Interactive Story
A project for history to present and teach about the story of Billy the Kid.

## Who should use this?
Anyone who's interested in the history of Billy the Kid of course, or if you need to study for a test tomorrow and want something quick and easy to read.

## How else can I view this?
While I would provide a Google Slides or a PowerPoint version of this for ease of use, that would defeat the purpose of this project in the first place because why wouldn't I just make a slideshow instead? This project was meant to be a learning experience in terminal manipulation as well as just a general way to make sure I keep my skills in this language up to par.
